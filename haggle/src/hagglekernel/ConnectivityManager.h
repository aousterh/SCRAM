/** Connectivity manager.

	The purpose of the connectivity manager is to find "nearby" haggle interfaces
	that represent interfacing points to other Haggle nodes. The Connectivity manager,
	however, knows nothing about the nodes and which one of them an interface
	belongs to. Its only task is to report when interfaces are discovered and
	when they disappear.
	Whenever a new interface is discovered, the Connectivity manager reports the 
	presence of the interface through a public event.
	"Nearby" can, e.g., mean within bluetooth range, or within the same ethernet
	segment.

	The Connectivity manager achieves its task by adding, removing and maintaining
	interfaces in the "Interface store", which stores currently active interfaces
	in the system. The actual detection of interfaces is delegated to connectivity
	modules that run in separate threads. The Connectivity manager maintains the
	current active connectivities in a connectivity module registry. It uses a
	private event to communicate with the modules.

	When detecting interfaces which go down non-silently, you should do
	the following to notify haggle about them:

	1. When the interface comes online, call report_interface.
	2. When the interface goes down, call delete_interface.


	To notify haggle about interfaces coming up and going down, when 
	they silently go down, do the following in the detect loop:

	1.	call age_interfaces
	2.	Detect interfaces. Call report_interface for each interface found. 
	

	When a local interface goes down, all child interfaces will automatically
	go down when the local parent interface is deleted.
