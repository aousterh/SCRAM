Building Haggle agains OMNeT++ simulation environment

This is work in progress.

1. Compile and install OMNeT++ somewhere on your machine.

2. You need to set the PATH and other OMNeT++ environment variables as
instructed by the OMNeT++ build system.

3. You need to run ./configure in the top level Haggle source
directory with the option --enable-omnetpp, e.g.:

> ./configure --enable-omnetpp

4. Now build haggle. A libhaggleopp.a library will be built that the
OMNeT++ simulation environment can link against.

5. Enter the hagglesim directory and run the following command (this
should probably be integrated into the Haggle build system at a later
time:

> opp_makemake -x -I../ -I../../utils/ -I/usr/include/libxml2/ ../libhaggleopp.a ../../utils/libhaggleutils.a -f

6. Now build the simulator by running make in the same directory:

> make

7. You should now have a hagglesim executable that you can run.
