/*
	Threading - how to implement, start and stop a thread

	People new to Haggle: Read this whole text through BEFORE implementing a
	thread, to avoid confusion about how threads work.


	A runnable object:

	When implementing something which needs a thread, a class that inherits
	from a runnable (directly or indirectly) is needed. The runnable class
	would be declared something like:

		class MyRunnable : public Runnable {
			void run();
			void cleanup();
		};

	The Runnable class provides a mutex that any child class can use, and a
	Condition, which will be discussed later.

	The class has to implement both run() and cleanup(), even if they are
	empty.


	A thread:

	A thread is created like so:

		myThread = new Thread(myRunnable);

	where myRunnable is an object of type MyRunnable, of course.


	Starting a thread:

	Creating a thread doesn't make the thread run. To start the thread you have
	to do the following:

		myThread->start();

	After which the thread starts. The thread executes the function run() in
	the runnable given when creating the thread, and then cleanup() (same
	object), after which it terminates.


	Terminating a thread:

	A thread can terminate when its job is done, by simply exiting both the
	run() and cleanup() methods. A thread can also be told to terminate by
	another thread (or itself). Doing this requires that myRunnable->run() is
	declared such that it periodically call:

		cond->wait(mutex)

	or

		cond->timedWait(mutex, <time to wait>)

	When the return value is <What should it be??> the run() function should
	terminate.

	In order to signal a thread to terminate via the Condition, as
	explained above, you can call either:

		myThread->cancel();

	or
		myThread->stop();

	Calling cancel() tells the thread to stop, and returns immediately. The
	thread may still be executing, however, so you cannot delete the runnable
	until you are certain the thread has stopped executing, or Haggle
	will most likely crash!

	Calling stop() tells the thread to stop, and waits for it to do so before
	returning. After stop() returns, you can safely delete the runnable. If the
	operation that the runnable is doing may take some time to reach a check of
	the Condition, the main haggle thread should not be waiting on it.
