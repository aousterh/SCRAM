/**
	A thread-safe queue. It's main purpose is to transfer data between modules
	and worker threads (manager modules).
	
	This queue is not quite thread safe. This is not yet a problem in Haggle,
	because the problem only arises when there is more than one thread getting
	things through the queue, and so far this doesn't happen in Haggle.
	
	The problem is that if there is more than one thread getting data from the 
	queue, only one element in the queue, and both threads try to retrieve at 
	the same time, both may see the signal as being up, even though there is 
	only one element in the queue.
	
	This would cause one of the threads to retrieve the object, and the other 
	to get NULL. This may also corrupt the list and break the entire Queue.
	
	The ONLY reason why this class is not called "Queue" is because there are
	multiple references to the other "Queue" class in haggle, and I wanted to
	make a minimal change/addition. This way the old "Queue" class works just
	the same as before, but this queue class can also be used.
