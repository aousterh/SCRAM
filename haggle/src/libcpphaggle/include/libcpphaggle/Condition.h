/** Condition variable

	When running different threads, it is sometimes neccesary for a thread to
	rest and wait for new data or other event to deal with. This is where a
	condition variable comes in.

	Similarly to mutexes or sockets, a thread can wait on a condition variable,
	either indefinately (using wait), or for some specified time (using
	timedWait). Another thread can wake the thread waiting for the condition
	variable by calling the signal() function, which will immediately wake the
	waiting thread.


	Due to problems with the underlying impementations of condition variables,
	if there is more than one thread waiting on a condition variable, the
	result of calling broadcast() or signal() may be unexpected.

	For this reason, it is recommended that at most one thread waits on a
	condition variable at any time.
