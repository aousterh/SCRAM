This is the Java bindings for libhaggle.

To run from this dir (Linux/MacOS X):

> java -Djava.library.path=native/.libs -jar org.haggle.jar

This will execute a small test program in the jar file, which will try to connect to Haggle

To write a program using the bindings, include the org.haggle.jar file in the classpath.

To run the TestApp program on Android (once Haggle is installed):

$ adb shell 
# dalvikvm -classpath /system/framework/haggle.jar org.haggle.TestApp
 
Android

To create an Android class library from org.haggle.jar, execute the
following commands (assuming you have the Android SDK in your PATH):

> dx --dex --output=classes.dex org.haggle.jar
> aapt add haggle-android.jar classes.dex
