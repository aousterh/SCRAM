Mail proxy
===========================

Configuration of mail client
----------------------------

You need to configure an account on your mail client with the
following information:

Username: same as email (e.g., john.doe@haggle.org)
SMTP server: localhost port 2525
POP server: localhost port 11011

Start the mail proxy by executing ./haggleproxy.
Haggle must of course also be running first.

You can now connect with the mail client.

When you connect to the proxy you will be asked for a password.
You can then enter anything.
