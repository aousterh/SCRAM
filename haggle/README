Haggle Architecture Reference Implementation
============================================

NOTE: Always check http://code.google.com/p/haggle/w/list for the most
up to date information about Haggle, how to compile, supported
hardware, etc.

See AUTHORS for information on which people are responsible for
writing this code. You are encouraged to read this file in case you
are confused about what Haggle is, is not, and who you should contact
in case you have questions.

Target operating systems for Haggle are currently Windows/Windows
Mobile, Linux, MacOS X and Android.

The code should run on similar operating systems with little effort.

Tested hardware platforms:

* Linux computers
* Windows
* Nokia 770 (Linux on ARM)
* Any MacOS X machine (PPC/Intel)
* Samsung SGH-i600 (Windows Mobile on ARM)
* HTC Touch Diamond
* HTC S-620
* LG KS20 (experimental Bluetooth support)
* iPhone (limited functionality, needs jailbreak)
* T-Mobile G1 (or the Google Android developer phone)
* HTC Magic
* Google Nexus One

Complete functionality may not be supported on all platforms at all
times (e.g., Bluetooth or WiFi functionality may differ, or not work
at all, depending on platform).

Structure and overview
======================

See doc/CodeOverview.txt for a brief overview of the code.

Building
========

Linux and MacOS X requires standard build environments. Install XCode
in MacOS X and standard development headers and libraries in Linux
(and of course GCC). Linux and MacOS X use autotools. See the
autotools.HOWTO for instructions.

General dependencies:
---------------------

Currently, Haggle depends on the following libraries:

* libxml2 
* sqlite3
* libcrypto (part of OpenSSL)

These libraries are usually available on UNIX-like systems (e.g.,
Linux and Mac OS X). For Windows there are bundled versions of these
libraries along with Visual Studio project files to build them
automatically.

See, for example, the 'winmobile' directory for Visual Studio project
files that build the Windows Mobile version.

Windows mobile:
---------------

The following software packages need to be installed to build Haggle:

* Visual Studio 2008
* Windows Mobile 6 Standard or Professional SDK 
* ActiveSync 4.5 (not needed with Windows Vista as it uses mobile device 
center instead)

Project files to build Haggle are found in the "winmobile" directory.

Windows:
--------

You need Visual Studio 2008 or later.

Project files to build Haggle are found in the "windows" directory.

Mac OS X:
---------

Install XCode. You can build Haggle either using XCode project files
or by using autotools and make ("./configure && make"). In recent Mac
OS X versions you might have to install the Java developer package to
be able to build the Java bindings for libhaggle. This package is
available from http://connect.apple.com/.

Linux:
------

Most Linux distributions have modular software package systems that
allow only minimal development environments to be installed. This
frequently leads to problems of missing development packages when
trying to compile Haggle. The goal is that the autotools system should
capture these dependencies and inform the user exactly which
development packages need to be installed. However, sometimes during
development, this system is not updated to cope with new dependencies.

To minimize the problems, please make sure that at least the following
packages are installed (list is for debian based distributions, e.g.,
Ubuntu):

* build-essential (meta-package that includes libc6-dev, gcc, g++, 
  make, etc.)
* automake
* autoconf
* libtool
* libsqlite3-dev
* libxml2-dev
* libbluetooth-dev
* libdbus-1-3
* libdbus-1-dev 
* libssl-dev

The exact package names may of course vary.
