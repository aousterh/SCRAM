Haggle code style
=================

The basic code style used in Haggle is a variant of the Linux kernel
C-style. The Linux style is in turn based on the well known Kernighan
and Ritchie style (K&R). The Linux kernel documentation has a good
document on the rationale behind this style and is a good read in
general. The document is found in 'Documentation/CodingStyle' in the
Linux source tree, or can be easily Googled.

Although the Linux style is for C, and Haggle is mostly written in
C++, it is still a good base and guide line.

A good C++ guideline is Google's C++-style guidelines, which use a
similar coding style as the C-style used in the Linux kernel.

However, one annoyance with the Google style is its 2-char
indentations, which makes it difficult to get a good overview of the
code and encourages deeply nested functions. As the Linux style guide
points out, you should try to avoid more than 3 levels of indentation
in order to make the code more readable. Haggle therefore uses
Google's C++ style with 8-char indentations.

In this directory, you will find Google's C/C++ style for Emacs, with
the only modification that it uses 8-char indentations instead of
2-char ones.
